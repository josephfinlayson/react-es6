ES6 Classes
   pros:
    idiomatic JS
    just plain objects (can be modified with object assign/extend)
    Extensible, composable

   cons:
    no mixins
    no autobinding

Show syntatic binding
Show mixin with decorators
Show object extension, using eval()
Show prototype override (searchHandler, )
